            <p>I started learning the basics of Javascripts in the year 2017. It's only until the summer of 2018 at the
                Nextech Internship that I
                learned about design thinking and how to use HTML,CSS and more of JAVASCRIPT. Later on I got to learn some bootstrap and Jquery
                who
                proof to be very useful in the coding world. </p>
